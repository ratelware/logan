## How to contribute

Hey, thanks for being interested in contributing to Logan! It's really simple, see details below!

### Have an idea?

Write an issue! We'll review it as soon as possible (no promises though!) and reply in the issue thread about proceeding.
If we agree the issue is important, we'll include it in the backlog. 

### Found a bug?

Great! Well, it's not great that we have bugs but hey, it's software, right? Please create an issue, maybe write some code if you want to fix it?

### Want to contribute some code?

If you want to write code for an existing issue - great! Just let us know in the issue, so that we won't duplicate your work. 

Ideally you could first describe the changes in the issue and then make a pull request - but if the changes are simple, pull request alone will suffice!

### Want to work on something that is not yet accepted? 

Well, that's a little slippery - it's always better to first agree on the scope and then write code, so that you won't be writing features that are 
already there or just designed to work otherwise.

That said, if you find an obvious bug, do not hesitate to fix it and issue a pull request immediately.

### Want to run tests?

Awesome! Download the app, use it, report issues if something is wrong!

### Want to share the knowledge? 

Splendid! Do a talk, podcast, blog post, video or whatever you're doing. 
Let us know if you need any support and if we can link it in the project!
